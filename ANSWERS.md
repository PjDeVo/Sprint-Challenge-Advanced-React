- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
      Class components are almost considered legacy code at this point. Funciton components have taken over however legacy apps with react will consist of them and it is important toknow how to
      manipualte them as well as the lifecycle methods.

* [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
      ComponentDidMount = used (in my experience) for api calls to pass data. you know the component is mounting and now it's time to bring in data.
      render - which is considered a lifecycle method and used to display the information code passed to the componenet
      ComponentDidUpdate - what to do on a change.

* [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      Not only reduce code but make it easier to read as well as reuse stateful logic.

* [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      so that if someone comes in to make a change (even if that someone is us further down the line) we can see how and why our code was written a certain way.
